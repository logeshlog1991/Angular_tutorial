Preparing all your content first is the same process a web designer goes through when designing a home page, as it helps them prioritise the different content based on it’s importance on the page.  It’s a bit like the way a chef prepares all the ingredients before making a dish.  It makes the process more efficient and it’s less likely you’ll forget an ingredient.  Simple logic dictates where certain content should go.  For example, you wouldn’t put your logo at the bottom of your page as the logo is the way people find out which website they’re on and people expect it to be at the very top of the page.  The website’s navigation menu is much the same - people expect it to be at the top of the page.  You wouldn’t put your call to action buttons at the top of the page as visitors haven’t learnt anything about your business yet and it’s a bit premature to ask them to make contact with you or even click through to one of your other pages.  For other aspects of the layout it gets a little trickier.
